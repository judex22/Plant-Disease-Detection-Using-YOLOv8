# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-YOLOv8

The Project aims to use the latest state-of-the-art YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) model developed by Ultralytics in 2023, for detecting Plant Diseases using the 
PlantDoc Dataset obtained from Roboflow platform. The model achieved a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.7% at 50% Intersection Over Union (IoU), which is the metric used to evaluate the model.

This Project was implemented as a Part of my University Disseration at Queen Mary University of London. In this repository, I have included my dissertation thesis, Powerpoint 
and video presentation, as well as two notebooks containing downloading the dataset from Roboflow platform and training the model using pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
